          GIT is a version control system that allow developers manage their
          code space more efficiently
        </p>
        <p>
          These days GIT is almost used by every tech companies. So, it' worth
          learning.
        </p>
        <p>To Get started, first, make sure you have git installed.</p>
        <p>
          If you are on linux, don't worry git is already on your machine. But,
          if you are on the fu*king windows you have to installed it manually by
          clicking <a href="https://git-scm.com/">here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>Once you ready with GIT type this commend in your terminal.</p>
        <br />
        <li>
          <code>git -v</code>
        </li>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Basic_commends">
        <header>Basic commends</header>
        <p>In GIT, some commands are used offend by developers. Such as:</p>
        <li><code> git add . </code></li>
        <li><code> git commit -m "commit message" </code></li>
        <li><code>git push</code></li>
        <p>Lemme explain these terms.</p>
        <p>git add will stage the changes.</p>
        <p>git commit will commit the staged changes.</p>
        <p>And finally, git push will upload the code to remote directory.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Branching">
        <header>Branching</header>
        <p>
          Branching is a very interesting topic. Branches are like multi
          dimension that allow developers work on the same project but without
          affecting the each others code. Confusing !?. Lets take a look at an
          example of a branch.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are working on full stack web project. You are a frontend
          developer and your friend Elon Musk is back developer. If you both
          work without branches you may encounter some problem during the
          development. Thats hare git branches come to handy.
        </p>
        <p>Just run.</p>
        <code>git branch front-end</code>
        <code>git checkout front-end</code>
        <p>
          Tadaaa, now you have a copy of the project that only for you. All you
          have to make the changes in your front-end branch and after everything
          finished just merge your frond-end code with the main branch where the
          final codes will be.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Contribution">
        <header>Contribution</header>
        <p>GIT also help in open source projects linux linux.</p>
        <p>
          You can clone others repository and make some changes add it; commit
          it; and push it;
        </p>
        <p>Here is the code for cloning onto others projects</p>
        <code>git clone https://github.com/itsmefminsaf/freecodecamp</code>
        <p>
          Now, you can edit this website and rise a pull request. After I accept
          it the changed you kde live on this website.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="What_is_Github">
        <header>What is Github</header>
        <p>
          You can notice in the git clone these is something github. Github is a
          remote git repository service provider. We can save our works in cloud
          so we won't lose our codes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you "is that Github being only chose for git remote repository. No,
          actually not. These is a lot of alternatives for Github. Such as:"
        </p>
        <li>Bit bucket</li>
        <li>Gitlab</li>
        <li>and so...</li>
        <p>But, GIthub is the popular one.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="How_to_use_Github">
        <header>How to use Github</header>
        <p>
          To use Github you have to create an account. Go and
          <a href="https://githu.com">create</a> one first.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, create a new repository and copy the url and set the
          repository as the remote origin of your local project by running this
          command in your terminal.
        </p>
        <code>git remote origin -u main</code>
        <p>Now if you push your code it directly goes to Github repository.</p>
